        <p>
			This research work was created primarily to address problems in solid waste management, specifically the inadequacy of garbage collection scheduling, the use of less modern technology, and poor management of the internal staff. The research was successful in improving solid waste management by providing a dynamic schedule for garbage collection, a map that can be used to display predicted garbage dumps based on location type, an IoT-based garbage bin for better city management, and a service rating system to evaluate garbage collectors' services. Several machine learning models, NLP models, optimization algorithms, and IoT technology were used in this study, and their performance was evaluated using previously unseen data. This study used several machine learning models, NLP models, optimization algorithms, and IoT technology, and these models and technologies were tested on gathered and pre-processed data to assess the performance of the components. The accuracy of the models used in this research will be improved in future work for improved performance. Furthermore, more features will be added to the system to improve solid waste management in a more user-friendly manner.        </p>
        <h4>01. Illegal garbage hotspots prediction.</h4>
		<p>Solid waste management is a critical component when it comes to urban areas. Due to inadequate waste management infrastructure and municipal collection efficiency, city dwellers are compelled to dispose of their solid waste in unauthorized waste [2]. 
Some research articles have been shown that large volume of waste is generated from various constructions and demolitions [3][4]. As a developing country, the tendency of the country is decreasing as a result of these types of waste collection.
The past decades have seen an improvement in human life quality and the rapid development of the construction industry as a result of rapid social and economic development. Meanwhile, illegal solid waste dumping has become a major problem. Using the systematic review method, this study critically examined the literature on illegal dumping published since 1990, as well as the current status and future trends of related research. According to the findings, current research on illegal dumping focuses primarily on four areas: 
•	environmental science and toxicology
•	economics
•	management
•	use of emerging technologies
This critical review revealed that, while the problem of illegal dumping has received widespread attention in recent years, some questions remain unanswered.

However, from the standpoint of toxicology, some studies have included electronic waste. The presence of these wastes will have serious consequences for the surrounding environment, and some of the wastes may contain harmful ingredients (such as heavy metals) that will have an impact on human health. As a result, there is an urgent need to manage illegal dumping and its consequences [4]. 
This illegal dumping not only violates the country's ethics, but it also has a direct impact on human health, as Colombo is already overcrowded. Several epidemiological studies on the potential adverse health effects of living near toxic waste dump sites have recently been conducted in various countries. According to this article, there is a potential age-adjusted standardized mortality rate associated with some specific cancer types [5]. Sri Lanka, as a developing country, is facing deadly viruses such as dengue, malaria, etc., and resources have confirmed that the source of these viruses is open garbage dumps.
The effluent effect depends on the effluent composition and the illegal disposal practices [6]. Waste composition includes a variety of substances, particularly toxic waste from the final stages of industrial activities: copper, arsenic, mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, hydrocarbons, and so on. Illegal burying in areas not legally designated as toxic waste dump sites, such as cultivable areas, roads, and buildings, as well as construction yards, is one type of waste disposal practice [7]. Furthermore, as demonstrated in this article [8], illegal waste burning and fires set up by residents to burn garbage bags piled up in the streets have significantly contributed to the increase in environmental pollution, particularly dioxins.
</p>
          <h4>02. Dynamic schedule for managing the overall garbage collection process .</h4>
		  <p>Solid waste management involves the processes of generation, collection, transport, treatment, value recovery, and subsequent disposal. Poor design of any of these processes increases operational cost and can result in environmental pollution [4]. The collection and transportation process alone, for instance, accounts for approximately 60% - 80% of total cost for solid waste management [5]. Inefficient solid waste collection and transport significantly affect management companies by increasing operational cost and subsequently reducing profit. Cost reduction with respect to waste collection and transportation is essential if sustainable solid waste management is to be achieved in developing economies. Collection and transportation of solid waste should therefore be executed in ways that will ensure cost reduction as well as environmental conservation.
	According to the reports of the global waste management market assessment (2007), they have reported MSW generation globally as 802 billion tons and annual increase rate as 8%. In many developing counties in Asia, the services related to solid waste management are very far from satisfactory [6]. Sri Lanka is also facing serious problems when considering to MSW management as the other developing countries in Asia. When considering year 2009, Sri Lanka produce 7000 metric tons of solid trash every day, with the Western Province accounting for roughly 60% of the country's solid waste. Each person produces 0.4–1 kilogram of garbage every day on average [7]. About 3242 metric tons were collected by the local Authorities daily and the highest amount of 1783 metric tons were collected daily by the western province. The highest population reported from Colombo district which collects 1284 metric tons of solid waste. Western Province in Sri Lanka is the highest waste generator consisting of three districts are Gampaha, and Kalutara. Among them, Colombo District is the most waste generator due to its relatively high population density. According to the research in 1999, it has been proved that the average MSW generation capacity hac increased year by year as in 1999 it was 0.89 kg /cap/day. And it will approach 1.0kg/cap/day by 2025[6].
	The local authorities in Sri Lanka have not full fill the MSW delivering in to required limits in waste management service. The situation happens almost in all developing countries. The disposed waste is not collected properly by the local authorities at present due to many shortages such as the vehicles that are not good condition, lack of skilled labors and there is no proper schedule to allocate the labors to garbage collection process for a particular area. Now a days, most of the municipal councils do the solid waste collection process from house to house [8]. In addition, the community also participate actively and gives their fullest support for some municipal councils. All though the small-scale composting, and biogas production technology has become an important topic recently and some local authorities have taken necessary steps to make them popular, these options have not been successful as the people are still not aware with them.
By considering the above-mentioned factors we can come to a conclusion that with the rapid increasement of the population there will be heaps of waste accumulated in the environment, but as there is no proper way to collect the waste. So that it has become a major threat that causes the environment pollution throughout the world. To make this waste collection process more efficient and productive, much research has been done to come up with an optimum solution.
</P>
      
      <h4>03. Smart Garbage Monitoring System  </h4>
      <p>Nowadays, because of this rapid growth of population and waste generation, the efficient disposal of garbage became a huge problem all over the country especially, in urban areas consisting of the above-mentioned sources. Due to this inefficient way of disposal of garbage, we see waste products increasing in multiple sectors. If this waste is not properly disposed of, it can lead to the spreading of several diseases and huge environmental pollution [5], a severe and contagious sickness is triggered, as well as a foul odor, which may induce illness in humans [6]. In the rapidly urbanizing neighborhood, there are now a variety of flats and apartments to choose from. This is due to increased housing demand because of people migrating from villages to cities in search of work. The government has built flats, apartments, and condominiums to accommodate the growing population in the urbanized area. Residents of the flats are dealing with several challenges. One of them is the problem of disposing of household solid waste, which pollutes the environment [6]. 
Much research has taken place to solve this tremendous problem around the world. There we often see the uses of ultrasonic sensors and microcontrollers. Study [1] mentioned a system that consists of two parts: software and special signaling equipment which is placed on the side walls of the bin. Two parts are the transmitter and sensor. The sensor is used to indicate the level of the bin whereas the transmitter is used for transmitting data. By considering those components Research [1] proposed a system to identify the garbage levels of a bin and transmit data. There they used LED indicators for identifying purposes. And to identify the bin they have used RFID technology. The key motivation of this study is to achieve efficiency in the waste management sector. Another study [3] has proposed a system to identify garbage with help of a camera and chemical sensors. These sensors and cameras are mounted to the track which will load the garbage. The camera continuously records photos for garbage bins, which are then sent to the workstation through radio frequency identification (RFID), GPS, and GIS. And chemical sensors that measure the chemical reactivity of wastes and therefore can identify between biodegradable and non-biodegradable wastes.
Research [6] offers a system with four specific objectives to overcome their main objective, which is to design, develop and implement an automated garbage monitoring system. The specific objectives of this research are as follows: 
•	Analyzing the performed works so far to monitor the garbage.
•	Propose a garbage monitoring system that can be controlled.
•	Use an Arduino microcontroller to simulate the design.
•	Implement the simulated design.
They arrived at a conclusion, understanding public concerns about growing resource consumption and trash generation is critical, and as a result, policymakers have pushed recycling and reuse measures to minimize the demand for raw materials and limit the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. Research [7] and [8] proposed a system using IR sensors to detect garbage in the dustbin by radiating infrared wavelengths which are invisible to the human eye. There the IR sensor acts as a level detector, the same as in the above research the output of the level detector is transmitted to the microcontroller.

        <h4>04.Service Rating Algorithm for Evaluating Garbage Collectors’ Performance.</h4>
        <p> 
					Solid waste is a popular hot topic in most countries.  Sri Lanka is also having so many discussions on this topic. [1] The amount of solid garbage produced in Sri Lanka has increased considerably during the previous decade. Risen because of a variety of circumstances, including population growth, urbanization, increased economic activity in metropolitan areas, and a lack of awareness about solid waste management.
			Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generation per person, effective SWM is a major challenge in a city with high population density such as Colombo. Because Sri Lanka is home to a diverse range of religious groups, cultures, and traditions, attaining environmental sustainability in a country with rapid population growth and rising living standards is difficult. Sri Lanka's SWM systems have stayed mainly intact despite tremendous advances in areas such as social, and economic development [2].
			Sri Lanka creates 7000MT of solid trash each day with the western province producing roughly 60% of the waste [1]. The SWM division of the Colombo Municipal Council oversees the collecting, transporting, and disposing of municipal waste in Colombo City. Colombo has a population of roughly 555,031 people, and garbage collection is around 500 MT each day. In addition, an estimated 600,000 individuals from across the island come to the city daily for commercial, job, school, healthcare, tourism, and other reasons [2]. All these individuals contribute to the collection of solid waste in Colombo City. Only half of the waste generated is collected, according to the Waste Management Authority and the Central Environmental Authority [3].
			MSW, usually referred to as trash or rubbish, is everything we discard after using it for daily purposes. Food waste, plastic waste, cardboard waste, metal, glass waste, wood and fabric, paint and batteries, and other materials are all included in MSW. Waste can be generated from houses, hospitals, schools, offices, and other factories [1]. Globally, 0.74 kilograms of solid garbage may create per person every day [2].
			The majority of low-income third-world nations do not sustainably manage MSW. The majority of countries dispose of MSW in open areas or by burning it. However, this will have grave consequences for the ecosystem.
			Due to improper collection of MSW in a timely and systematic manner, the beauty and health condition around the Colombo area is under serious threat. In addition, the accumulation of rubbish around roads, the littering of roads and streets, the clogging of sewers, and the failure to properly collect garbage in public places daily are having a major impact on the economy and mental health of the Colombo area today.
			With the intervention of the CMC, the garbage collection process and the road and street cleaning processes are being carried out with the participation of several private companies. Solid waste collection, garbage transportation, waste management, and road cleaning are the main responsibilities of the Municipal Council, and their responsibility is to maintain the cleanliness and sanitation of the city of Colombo.

          </p>




          <b><h2 style="text-align: center;">Research Problem and Gap</h2></b><br>
        <p>
			The main objective of the project is to design and develop a “Waste Management System for handling garbage collection process for efficiency ” as a web-based system which will assist in predicting  illegal waste hotspots, scheduling waste collection process, identify filled up garbage bins and and rating employees for their service.this research is unique in a way such that, it’s focused on developing a waste management solution that contains “Hotspot Garbage Prediction”, which can predict and map an illegal/hotspot waste disposal around Colombo Municipal Council, “Dynamic Scheduling for Garbage Collection”, which contains scheduling system to allocate staff and garbage trucks correctly to the process of collecting garbage. “Garbage Level Monitoring System based on IoT”, which can inform the municipal council about garbage bins before overflow. “Service Rating Component”, which can rate and rank the garbage collectors and users. And some additional features can be useful to handle and decrease the municipal solid waste issue in the municipal council.        
          <h4>01. Illegal garbage hotspots prediction.</h4>
        <p>Illegal waste has been identified as a major pollutant contributing to land degradation, with frequent illegal waste disposal causing abnormal concentrations of heavy metals, hydrocarbons, nitrogen, and volatile organic compounds, such as solvents or gasoline, in surrounding soils and water [16].
Civilians used to dump their household waste in Sri Lanka due to the lack of a waste management system, and in Colombo, almost all of the areas are urbanized, and illegal garbage dumping is a major problem. As a first step toward resolving this issue, 'Trash-pot' will present the Colombo Municipal Council. The majority of the research has focused on locating illegal waste through hard waste, which is obviously a time-consuming project that will require additional resources to complete [7].
On the other hand, some articles have gathered spatial data to predict illegal waste dumps, but the problem with that research is that gathering spatial data and identifying their spectral signatures are both time consuming and inefficient. [8].
This research is conducted in such a way that the user can directly access the city map and get a good idea about the areas that may contain illegal garbage dumps, allowing the city council to make the necessary arrangements during the relevant period.
The research [16] is studied on Queensland, Australia, in Sri Lanka mapping an illegal data using spatial data cannot be done and in here, as pilot we scoped the study area to known city area in Dematagoda, Wnathamaulla, Kuppiyawatte East, Kuppiyawatte West,Boralla North,Boralla South and Cinnamon Gardens. The novelty of this research area is that using survey-based datasets and city council-based datasets the expected outcome will be extracted and as a use of this implementation we can predict the garbage hotspots consistent in pilot area. 
</p>
          <h4>02. Dynamic schedule for managing the overall garbage collection process.</h4>
		  <p>Rapid industrialization and demographic explosion forced people to move from villages to cities, producing thousands of tons of solid waste every day [1]. Although waste generation in Sri Lanka is increasing rapidly day by day, one of the major shortcomings of the waste collection process in Sri Lanka is the lack of organization in proper collection and disposal process. We conducted a survey to get an idea about the current schedule of the waste collection and disposal process happening in Sri Lanka. As per the survey conducted, the daily collection and disposal process of garbage is being carried out according to a static schedule which is given by the municipal council, to each area
		  Though the municipal council has already introduced a “static schedule” to regulate the collection and disposal of waste that is accumulated in the environment on a daily basis which are based on consumption, the weakness of this static schedule which is introduced by municipal council is that it is not updated based on considerable factors such as the public events held in that particular area , local weather condition ,public holidays and seasonal festivals , service providers’ requirements and etc. Because of the changes that happen daily according to above-mentioned situations, sometimes the service providers will not be able to collect the garbage according to the static schedule and sometimes customers fail to deliver the garbage to the garbage collection truck according to the static schedule. It’s essential to have a dynamic schedule for the garbage collection process, which is updated dynamically according to the considerable factors, to keep the city clean. According to the available research papers there are much research that have been carried out to solve the garbage collection issue in urban areas. But each research is limited to one or two factors which limits the garage collection process. 
In Research [9], Only consider about the internal factors such as trucks , routes and staff how involve to the process . 	
Research [8], they use Marcov decition model for the process of allocating trucks, staff and routes for a dynamical schedule. When the schedule allocate truck to a particular route system monitors the routes and check the flexibility of the route and check whether the truck is able to cover that route. And also, this research explicitly models the variability in the workload that has faced by a truck and how it impacts on truck scheduling

</p>
      
          <h4>03. Smart Grabage Monitoring System.</h4>
      <p>Now days in most urban cities there are many public dustbins which are in very bad conditions [6]. This is the biggest problem in solid waste management in urban areas. This is happened because of peoples’ carelessness about garbage disposing. Most of the time we can see the garbage in these dustbins are all overflowed and also spelled out, but still many people are throwing garbage into the bins that are already filled up or overflowed [6]. To manage the growing population in the urban area who are mostly migrating from villages, there is a rapid growth of buildings such as flats, apartments, and housing schemes [7]. The above-mentioned problem is the biggest issue faced by the people who are living in these apartments. Garbage collection is done once a month in most housing buildings. Housing buildings are not like landed houses, the garbage bins placed inside are used by every resident in the same building [7]. So, the council needs to take necessary arrangements to clean up the bins hence these garbage bins have tendency to be filled up quickly.
         This has resulted in a significant deterioration in the condition of hygiene in the waste management system. The spillover of rubbish in civic places pollutes the environment in the surrounding areas. It has the potential to exacerbate a variety of serious ailments in the surrounding area. The impacted area's appraisal will be humiliated because of this. Garbage bins or dustbins are deposited past their capacity in numerous places throughout the world, making them inefficient. As the environment becomes filthier. Modern strategies for improved solid waste segregation, collection, and disposal are urgently required.
The design and operation of waste management systems require accurate projection of future waste creation rates. The forecasting of trash generation rates serves as a foundation for implementation. It is extremely difficult to forecast future home garbage generation rates. The significant variability and unpredictability of the data is one of the major obstacles to employing forecasting models to support waste management systems

		 </p>

        <h4>04. Service Rating Algorithm for Evaluating Garbage Collectors’ Performance. </h4>
        <p>
					Currently, garbage collectors are not subjected to any rating or productivity measurement. Hence, the garbage collection service faces some issues [1]. As garbage decomposition is not handled properly it has become a major issue with increasing diseases [2]. This planned system has taken the necessary steps to fix that issue. As a solution, it was decided to build up an algorithm for the improvement of the efficiency and productivity of garbage collecting people.
			According to the available research papers, there is much research has been carried out on the solid waste management system. Responses to the garbage collection service using the Natural Language Process have not been analyzed, and responses to other products have been analyzed. In addition, although research has been conducted to identify factors contributing to waste generation and waste management in construction, the factors required to evaluate the services of waste collectors have not yet been accurately identified.Research [3] has identified factors that affected municipal expenditures for waste-collection services per capita and they evaluated the influence of competition intensity on the supply side of the market on the efficiency of waste-collection services. Research [4] has identified Key factors in levels of public satisfaction with urban waste collection. Research [5] has reviewed the types of models that are currently being used in the field of municipal waste management and pointed out some of their key flaws. Research [6] has identified critical success factors for the onsite sorting of construction waste. This study was conducted solely to identify significant factors for evaluating service improvement, and it will enable future work to be evaluated to improve service offerings. Research [7] has developed performance indicators for municipal solid waste management.
