        <b><h2 style="text-align: center;">Literature Survey</h2></b><br>
        <p>This research work was created primarily to address the limitations associated with low accuracy and reliability in PD diagnosis models, 'Neura Trace PD' offers a distinctive desktop-based solution. This solution takes a multi-faceted approach, considering four key aspects rather than relying solely on one aspect for diagnosis. By incorporating a range of features or data sources, our aim is to provide more accurate and reliable results in the screening of Parkinson's Disease. This holistic approach can potentially enhance the diagnostic accuracy and reduce the risk of misclassification, ultimately contributing to improved patient care and clinical decision-making. </p>
        <h4>01. Parkinson’s disease screening using voice </h4>
		<p>In [2], the authors utilized K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to analyze voice data for Parkinson's Disease (PD) diagnosis. They employed Summarized-Leave-One-Out (s-LOO) and Leave-One-Out-Subject (LOSO) validation procedures to assess the model's performance, achieving a highest accuracy of 85.5%. However, it's crucial to highlight the potential disadvantages in this context, particularly the relatively low accuracy rate. While 85.5% accuracy is a notable achievement, it falls short of being a highly reliable diagnostic tool for PD. Low accuracy can result in false positives and false negatives, which can have significant implications for patient care.</p>
          <h4>02. Parkinson's disease screening using Facial Expressions </h4>
		  <p>The study referenced as [3] demonstrates the potential of utilizing facial expressions from online videos to detect PD, achieving an accuracy rate of 95%. The videos collected from online sources may not represent a diverse and well-balanced sample of the population, as the individuals featured in these videos are self-selected or may not be representative of the broader population.</P>
      
      <h4>03. Parkinson's disease screening using Hand Drawings.</h4>
      <p>In "A step towards automated PD diagnosis," Pereira et al. [1] employed machine learning and computer vision to recognize PD using "Hand-PD" dataset. Using OPF, SVM, and Naive Bayes, Naive Bayes achieved 78.9% accuracy, showing potential for improvement due to its relatively lower accuracy. Notably, the study did not consider the optimization of image resolution, which could significantly impact the accuracy of PD diagnosis using machine learning techniques.</p>
</p>

        <h4>04. Parkinson's disease screening using MRI </h4>
        <p> In the study conducted by Dan Long et al. as referenced in [4], Support Vector Machines (SVM) were employed to classify individuals with early PD and Healthy Controls (HC). The research utilized multimodal MR imaging for each subject, which included functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) and structural images. Notably, they extracted features from rsfMRI at three different stages and extract features from structural images, including White Matter (WM) and Gray Matter (GM) volume. Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) was used to evaluate the SVM model's performance, which achieved an accuracy of 86.96%. However, it's important to acknowledge that this accuracy may be considered relatively low, and there's room for improvement, particularly by exploring connectivity patterns specific to Parkinson's Disease.

          <b><h2 style="text-align: center;">Research Problem and Gap</h2></b><br>
        <p>The main objective of this research is to develop a multi-modal diagnostic tool for early Parkinson's disease (PD) detection that integrates various data modalities, including brain MRI, hand drawings, facial expressions, and voice analysis. This tool aims to achieve high accuracy, accessibility, and user-friendliness. The research also seeks to validate the tool in clinical settings, address ethical considerations, and make it cost-effective, ultimately enhancing the early diagnosis and management of PD, leading to improved patient outcomes and a higher quality of life for individuals at risk of this neurodegenerative condition. </p>
